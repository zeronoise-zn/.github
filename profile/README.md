The brand was established in 2018 following a few years of activities as supplier to other well-established brands. [ZeroNoise](https://racingforce.com/zeronoise/) was founded with the idea of offering its unique and proprietary technology through a proprietary trademark. Acquired in 2019 by [Racing Force Group](https://racingforce.com/), ZeroNoise is the group brand that engineers, develops and manufactures technology for the racing industry. The tech products that are developed under the ZeroNoise brand are mainly focused on audio communication through intercom systems that are known and appreciated for their unique design and high-performance results. These products are used by professional teams in the main rally and rally-raid competitions and by amateur racers in many other forms of auto racing competitions. 

ZeroNoise developed the world first in-helmet camera (international [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220047035A1/)) for real-time TV broadcasting which is homologated by [FIA](https://www.fia.com/). Driverâ€™s Eye debuted in 2019 in Formula E and is currently adopted by drivers in major championships as Formula1Â® and Supercars. 

The 2024 year brings two new products to the ZeroNoise portfolio: the [Fury](https://github.com/zeronoise-zn/zn-fury/) digital amplifier and the [Wired Wireless](https://github.com/zeronoise-zn/zn-wired-wireless/) communication system premiered to dealers at [Racing Force Group World Client Meeting](https://racingforce.com/media/press-release/record-figures-for-the-2023-racing-force-world-meeting-in-bahrain/) held in October 2023 in Bahrain.
